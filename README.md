## Project Title: "RAG-based Query System for Extracting Python Built-In Functions from PDF"

### Project Description:
This project builds an NLP-based query system utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to extract and generate answers from a PDF document containing Pythonâ€™s built-in functions. The system retrieves relevant document sections using a vector-based retrieval mechanism (e.g., using embeddings), then augments this information with a generative model to provide contextually relevant answers to user queries. The entire system is designed to process unstructured PDF data, transforming it into a queryable knowledge base.
